Hello friends,

I know many of us are #ADHD kids so I will keep this short.

We already getting good response on our WCN Subreddit, you can read this to see what I am proposing.

Could everyone be free Weds, Thurs or Friday next week for a Town Hall meeting on Youtube hangout for a discussion about formalising the channel?

Please send me your preferred day(s).

Thanks so much,

Chris
