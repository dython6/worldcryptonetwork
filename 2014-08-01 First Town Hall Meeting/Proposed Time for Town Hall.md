Thank-you to everyone who has signed up for the Town Hall this week.

Based on the preferences I propose the following. **Thursday  [3pm PDT / 6pm EDT / 11pm BST(UK)**](http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?qm=1&lid=1609350,2643743,4160021,5391959&h=2643743&date=2014-8-4&sln=23-24)

For anyone who cannot make it on Thursday I will also be available on the Friday for any follow up discussions. 

The agenda so far based on feedback and my own thoughts:

 * We have comments already on our [Sub Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldcryptonetwork/comments/2bn93t/lets_decentralise_the_world_and_make_world_crypto/) includi*
2.
