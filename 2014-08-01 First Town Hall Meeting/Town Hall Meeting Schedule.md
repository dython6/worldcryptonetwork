**Issue 1**  
**Formalising the way World Crypto Network is run**

At the moment it is run almost entirely by Thom.

If we want to see WCN continue how would we like to sustain it?

We have comments already on our [Sub Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldcryptonetwork/comments/2bn93t/lets_decentralise_the_world_and_make_world_crypto/) including setting up multi-signature wallets with [Bitcoin Armory](https://bitcoinarmory.com) and having elections.

Fundraising using [Jurisdictional Arbitrage](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldcryptonetwork/comments/2cdb8i/jurisdictional_arbitrage/) by distributing keys with people across the world. @ddscout on Reddit has said he feels it is a bit paranoid.  


**Issue 2**  
**Decentralise the World campaign**

As a test bed for a campaign Nick and Chris have suggested distributing Open Source software as well as the block chain.

**Issue 3**  
**Show ideas and formats**

Who wants to work up a schedule for the network?

How should we select shows?

Could we have one day per week where new people audition and the audience votes them in using the block chain for voting?  
  
**Issue 4**  
**World Crypto Network website and forum**

What should it communicate?

Would anyone like to break off in to a team to design it?
