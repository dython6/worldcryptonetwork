Thank-you to everyone who has signed up for the Town Hall this week.

Based on the preferences I propose the following. **Thursday  [3pm PDT / 6pm EDT / 11pm BST(UK)**](http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?qm=1&lid=1609350,2643743,4160021,5391959&h=2643743&date=2014-8-4&sln=23-24)

For anyone who cannot make it on Thursday I will also be available on the Friday for any follow up discussions. 

The agenda so far based on feedback and my own thoughts:

1.  **Formalising the way World Crypto Network is run**
At the moment it is run almost entirely by Thom.
If we want to see WCN continue how would we like to sustain it?
We have comments already on our [Sub Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldcryptonetwork/comments/2bn93t/lets_decentralise_the_world_and_make_world_crypto/) including setting up multi-signature wallets with [Bitcoin Armory](https://bitcoinarmory.com) and having elections.

2.  **Decentralise the World campaign**
 As a test bed for a campaign Nick and Chris have suggested distributing Open Source software as well as the block chain.

3. **Show ideas and formats**
Work up a schedule for the network.
How should we select shows?
Could we have one day per week where new people audition and the audience votes them in using the block chain for voting?

4. **World Crypto Network website and forum**
What should it communicate?
Would anyone like to break off in to a team to design it?

5.
