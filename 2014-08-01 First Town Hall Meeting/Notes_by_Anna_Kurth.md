# WCN 1st TownHallMeeting / thoughts & notes
## by [Anna Kurth](https://twitter.com/AnnaKNonE)

# Administration:

Have a googleSheet where all enter 
- name/persona
- email address
- timezone they are 'live' available
- amount of time they are able to contribute eg per week!! (This one would really help to get a good overview on how much work can actually be done with the existing participants)
- and then all mark in the section of tasks you want to contribute to ---> then only ppl working on this issue can get together on their own w/out spamming all participants with mails / status reports

but: how to make the sheet visible to all that want in but prevent it from spammers/malicious parties that eg abuse given email addresses?? 



# List of Tasks 

that could be / need to be executed / how one can contribute:

- running multisig armory and being available for elections
- writing resumees of last town hall meeting or agendas for the next one
- help administration with eg forwarding infos to ppl that work on that issue

- design website / coordinate with webdesigner
- actively reach out directly towards groups, persons for collaboration 
- handling tweets / mail / social media accounts / youtube comments
- contribute written content (eg for website)

- I want to start (co-)hosting a show
- I have ready video content / a show running which I want to broadcast through WCN

- code something... 

- Upload Videos to Youtube incl. description / key words / tags / transcripts
- Process clips that have been sent in (see more details below)



Get more ppl on board

Maybe introdroduce Incentives for active listeners (often commenting or active in Q&A) ??
eg Tipping them out of the WCN-pot

For tasks that nobody volunteers for right away: put the exact 'job description' including especially on how much time might have to be dedicated and get it out there via social media channels

New Logo Design - if necessary: Open contest, every draft that's been sent in (professional ones in applicliable fomats for all purposes, not just random jpgs) gets a little reward and the chosen one a bigger payment.




# Video content contribution


Short prerecorded clips sent in by ppl as Davi suggested @29:00 (similar to OpenMinute on BTC_Rush) 

--> But how to securely send in the videos?? if you provide a ftp to send up or so, how to avoid that ppl spam it or upload malware/virusses ?? What's the alternative method to submit?

Those short clips could be put together as a sequel, all with a short introduction of the contributor / shoutouts at the end / (maybe subtitles in engl if it comes in aforeign language)

The screening could also result not only  in an 'You're in or out' -decision but also in:
1) eg a fedback to sender how to improve their content (please use a better mic, your sound is shitty / try to be more structured / do include screenshots...) 
2) a 2-sentence resumee and that can be put up for group descision whether the sender is in our out.


Tasks for handling Clip contributions:

- clipping together video sequels that have been sent in, adding introduction / subtitles
- correspondence with contributors
- writing transcripts
- looking for someone to translate
- sort clips by topics


These clips could also contain 'Commercials' meaning ppl presenting their bitcoin-product/-project or their product which can be bought for btc or to promote their own blog/website (if somewhat related to crypto topics)
...Maybe sell this as adverstising slots...
